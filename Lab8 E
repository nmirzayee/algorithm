Below is a complete explanation of:

What the problem is actually asking

How to solve the problem (the idea behind the solution)

Clear explanation of your code line-by-line

This will let you fully understand the entire task.

🟩 1. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM ABOUT? (Human Explanation)

You are given n numbers:

L0, L1, L2, ..., L(n-1)


These numbers were produced by encoding a secret string using the rule:

For the secret characters:

c0, c1, c2, ..., c(n-1)


Convert each to a number:

'a' → 0
'b' → 1
'c' → 2
...
'z' → 25


Let these numbers be:

v0, v1, v2, ..., v(n-1)


Then each Li is computed as:

L0 = v0 * 1
L1 = v0 * 1 + v1 * 2
L2 = v0 * 1 + v1 * 2 + v2 * 4
L3 = v0 * 1 + v1 * 2 + v2 * 4 + v3 * 8
...
Li = Σ (vj * 2^j)


So each Li contains the sum of all previous character values multiplied by powers of 2.

🟦 2. WHAT IS THE TASK? (Your Job)

You must decode the original string from these cumulative sums.

For each Li, extract the new character value.

🟨 3. HOW TO SOLVE IT (Algorithm Idea)

We know that:

Li = previous_sum + vi * 2^i


Let:

prev = previous_sum = L(i-1)
power = 2^i


Then the current character value is:

vi = (Li - prev) / power


Once we get vi, we convert it back:

0 → 'a'
1 → 'b'
2 → 'c'
...

🟥 4. EXAMPLE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Suppose the encoded numbers are:

1 3 11


Decode them:

i = 0:
prev = 0
power = 1
v0 = (1 - 0)/1 = 1 → 'b'
prev = 1
power = 2

i = 1:
v1 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1 → 'b'
prev = 3
power = 4

i = 2:
v2 = (11 - 3)/4 = 2 → 'c'


So decoded string = "bbc".

🟩 5. CODE EXPLANATION LINE-BY-LINE

Now let’s explain exactly what your code does.

🔹 Input and setup
long long n;
cin >> n;


You read how many encoded values there are.

🔹 Variables used for decoding
long long prev = 0;
vector<char> str;
long long power_base = 1;
long long base = 2;


prev → stores previous encoded sum (L(i−1))

str → where we store the decoded characters

power_base → stores 2^i for decoding

base = 2 → fixed because the encoding uses powers of 2

🔹 Main decoding loop
while(n--) {
    long long length;
    cin >> length;


length = current Li (encoded value).

🔹 Decode the character value
long long sAsci = (length - prev) / power_base;


This applies:

vi = (Li - L(i-1)) / 2^i


This extracts the character's numeric value (0 to 25).

🔹 Convert number to letter
char s = sAsci + 'a';
str.push_back(s);


if sAsci = 0 → 'a'

if sAsci = 1 → 'b'

etc.

Then the character is added to the result string.

🔹 Update prev and power
prev = length;
power_base = power_base * base;


prev becomes the current total, ready for next iteration

power_base becomes 2^(i+1) for the next character

🔹 Print the decoded message
for(char &s: str) {
    cout << s;
}


Print all letters together (the decoded string).

🟩 6. COMPLETE SUMMARY (Very Short)
❗The problem:

You are given encoded numbers describing a string using cumulative sums with powers of 2.

❗Your job:

Recover the original string.

❗How:

At step i:

vi = (Li − L(i-1)) / 2^i


Convert vi to a character.

❗Your code:

Implements exactly this decoding process using prev and power_base.
