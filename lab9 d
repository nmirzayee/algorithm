Previous city = prev_city

Olzhas knows a list of cities = [city1, city2, ..., cityN]

Goal: Find all cities whose prefix matches the longest possible suffix of prev_city.

Example:

prev_city = "Kokshetau"
Olzhas cities = ["Astana", "Tauemel", "Tainan", "Almaty", "Budapest"]


Check suffixes of "Kokshetau": "u", "au", "tau", …

Find cities starting with "tau" → "Tauemel"

🔍 Step-by-step Algorithm

Let prev = prev_city

Let cities = [city1, city2, ..., cityN]

Initialize max_len = 0

Initialize answers = []

For each city in cities:

For l from 1 to len(prev):

Compare prev[-l:] (suffix of length l) with city[:l] (prefix of length l) ignoring case? (No, case matters here)

Keep track of maximum matching suffix length

After checking all cities, output all cities whose matching length = max_len

Time complexity: O(n * m), n = number of cities, m = length of city names → acceptable for ≤ 10⁴ cities


def solve():
    prev = input().strip()
    n = int(input())
    cities = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    
    max_len = 0
    result = []
    
    for city in cities:
        max_match = 0
        for l in range(1, min(len(prev), len(city)) + 1):
            if prev[-l:].lower() == city[:l].lower():
                max_match = l

        if max_match > max_len:
            max_len = max_match
            result = [city]
        elif max_match == max_len and max_len > 0:
            result.append(city)
    
    print(len(result))
    for city in result:
        print(city)
solve()
