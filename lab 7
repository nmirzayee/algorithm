Problem A: Simple Merge
Given a set of strings print the set sorted according to their size. If the size of the strings are equal, must maintain the original order of the set.

Input format
The first line of input has an integer 
 that indicates the number of sets of strings, each set may contain between 
 and 
 inclusive elements, and each of the strings of the set may contain between 
 and 
 inclusive characters(’
’ to ’
’).

Output format
The output should contain the set of input strings ordered by the length of strings.A blank space must be printed between two words.

Examples
Input
3
ab cd e j asd ljffg df
a a b b c c
xy yx zxy zx xzy xxx
Output
e j ab cd df asd ljffg 
a a b b c c 
xy yx zx zxy xzy xxx 
Input
4
aabc ddfd fbbe f baaad
fddf badcf aedbe cdb ae bbd
ada bc eaced dadab b aabc fbee
bedaf edde fcaa adbf beec
Output
f aabc ddfd fbbe baaad 
ae cdb bbd fddf badcf aedbe 
b bc ada aabc fbee eaced dadab 
edde fcaa adbf beec bedaf 

For each set:

You must sort the strings by their length (shortest first).

If two strings have equal length, you must keep their original order (stable sorting).

Print the sorted strings with a space after each word.

Each set is printed on a new line.

Python’s built-in sorted() is stable, so equal-length strings automatically keep original order.

✅ Algorithm Explanation (Step-by-Step)
Algorithm:

For each set of strings:

Read the input line.

Split the line into a list of strings.

Sort the list by:
→ key = len(string)
(Since Python sort is stable, equal-length items keep original order.)

Print the result as space-separated words and add a trailing space.

Time complexity:

Sorting each list: O(n log n)

Total: T × O(n log n) (well within limits)

Why Python’s sort works perfectly?

Because Python’s sort uses Timsort, which is stable.
Stable means:
