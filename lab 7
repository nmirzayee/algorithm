import sys

t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

for _ in range(t):
    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    words = line.split()
    words.sort(key=len)     # stable sort keeps original order
    print(*words)


Problem A: Simple Merge
Given a set of strings print the set sorted according to their size. If the size of the strings are equal, must maintain the original order of the set.

Input format
The first line of input has an integer 
 that indicates the number of sets of strings, each set may contain between 
 and 
 inclusive elements, and each of the strings of the set may contain between 
 and 
 inclusive characters(’
’ to ’
’).

Output format
The output should contain the set of input strings ordered by the length of strings.A blank space must be printed between two words.
