Problem C: House of love
Once upon a time, in one university, created a one organization called "House of love" in which friendship is the main value. So they created one test to know level of their friendship. Two person write some numbers and gives it to you, to check common numbers.

Input format
First line contain two numbers n,m. Size of arrays. Next 2 line contain n numbers of first person and m numbers of second.

Output format
Print common numbers.

Examples
Input
4 2
1 2 2 1
2 2
Output
2 2 
Input
3 5
4 9 5
4 3 2 1 9
Output
4 9 
Input
0 1
1
Output
Input
4 2
1 2 3 1
2 2
Output
2 


✅ Important Observation From Samples

You must print the multiset intersection, keeping the order of the first person’s array.

✔ Multiplicity = min(count in first, count in second)
✔ Order = order of the FIRST array
✔ No extra messages
✔ If nothing common → print NOTHING (empty line)
