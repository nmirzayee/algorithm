Problem C: House of love
Once upon a time, in one university, created a one organization called "House of love" in which friendship is the main value. So they created one test to know level of their friendship. Two person write some numbers and gives it to you, to check common numbers.

Input format
First line contain two numbers n,m. Size of arrays. Next 2 line contain n numbers of first person and m numbers of second.

Output format
Print common numbers.

Examples
Input
4 2
1 2 2 1
2 2
Output
2 2 
Input
3 5
4 9 5
4 3 2 1 9
Output
4 9 
Input
0 1
1
Output
Input
4 2
1 2 3 1
2 2
Output
2 


✅ Important Observation From Samples

You must print the multiset intersection, keeping the order of the first person’s array.

✔ Multiplicity = min(count in first, count in second)
✔ Order = order of the FIRST array
✔ No extra messages
✔ If nothing common → print NOTHING (empty line)

✅ Algorithm (Step-by-step)

Input:

Two integers n and m — sizes of arrays

Array A of size n (first person)

Array B of size m (second person)

Output:

The common numbers between A and B

Order must follow A

Each number appears min(count in A, count in B) times

✅ Steps

Read inputs
Read integers n and m, then read arrays A and B.

Create a frequency table for array B

Count how many times each number appears in B.

For example, if B = [2,2,3] → frequency = {2:2, 3:1}.

Initialize an empty list result
This will store the common numbers in correct order.

Traverse array A from left to right
For each element x in A:

Check if B still has this number available (frequency[x] > 0).

If yes:

Add x to the result.

Decrease the frequency of x in B by 1.

When traversal ends, print the result list

Print all numbers separated by spaces.

If result is empty → print nothing (empty line).

✅ Explanation of Why This Works

Using frequency ensures we print a number only as many times as it appears in both arrays.

Traversing A ensures the output order follows the first person’s list, exactly like the samples.

This produces a multiset intersection with stable order.
