Problem Understanding

We are given a string s which is a substring of many repetitions of some original string t.

Goal: find the minimum possible length of t.

Observation:

Let len(t) = L.

Then s is a substring of t + t + t + ....

The minimum L corresponds to the smallest period of s.

Example:

s = "bcabcab"


Original string t = "bca" → repeated gives "bcabcabcabc..."

"bcabcab" is a substring → minimal length = 3

Step 1: Compute prefix function

Use KMP prefix function (pi).

pi[i] = length of longest proper prefix which is also a suffix of s[:i+1].

Key formula:

If n = len(s) and pi[-1] = k, then:

minimum length of t
=
𝑛
−
𝑘
minimum length of t=n−k

Why?

The string repeats itself with period = n - pi[-1].

This is the shortest possible original string.

Step 2: Prefix function in Python
def compute_pi(s):
    n = len(s)
    pi = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        j = pi[i-1]
        while j > 0 and s[i] != s[j]:
            j = pi[j-1]
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            j += 1
        pi[i] = j
    return pi

Step 3: Solve Problem
def solve():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    pi = compute_pi(s)
    min_length = n - pi[-1]
    print(min_length)

Step 4: Test Examples

Example 1:

Input: zzz
pi = [0,1,2]
min_length = 3 - 2 = 1
Output: 1


Example 2:

Input: bcabcab
pi = [0,0,0,1,2,3,4]
min_length = 7 - 4 = 3
Output: 3

Step 5: Complexity

Prefix function computation: O(n)

Memory: O(n)

Works efficiently for strings up to length 10⁵ or more.
